    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I say that the system inside of the box is similar to the greedy cup siphon as it is able to hold water to the point where if enough water is added, it all gets siphoned out of the container of water.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a drink cooler container that's been locked in order to conceal the system that allows it to hold water inside of it where it stores enough water and lets all of it go down a funnel and out of the box.</p>
